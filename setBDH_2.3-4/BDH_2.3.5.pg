$PAR In the damped harmonic oscillator \( m\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + b \frac{dy}{dt} + ky = 0 \), we assume that the coefficients \(m\), \(b\), and \(k\) are positive. However, the rationale underlying the guess-and-test method made no such assumption, and the same analytic technique can be used if some or all of the coefficients of the equation are negative. 

$PAR Consider the harmonic oscillator equation for y(t) 
\[ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 3 \frac{dy}{dt} - 10y = 0. \]

(a) Using HPGSystemSolver from the DETools software, sketch the associated direction field. (you'll need to convert the second-order equation into a first-order system; no work to submit here)

$PAR (b) Using the guess-and-test method, find two nonzero solutions that are not multiples of one another.
$BR \(y_1(t) = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR \(y_2(t) = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR (c) For each solution, plot both its solution curve in the \(yv\)-plane and its \(y(t)\)- and \(v(t)\)-graphs. Use the direction field from (a), but sketch the solution curves in the \(yv\)-plane and the  \(y(t)\)- and \(v(t)\)-graphs by hand on paper.
$BR Which of the following curves most closely matches your graph? \{$mc->menu()\}

$PAR (c) \(\quad\) \{image("BDH_2.3.4.png",width=>500,height=>166)\} 
$PAR (d) \(\quad\) \{image("BDH_2.3.6.png",width=>500,height=>166)\}

$PAR What is different in this case, where \(k\) is negative?
